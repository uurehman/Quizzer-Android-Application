# QuizzerAndroidApplication
Quizzer is a simple application in which one can make quizzes (as teacher) and attempt quizzes (as student).

# Problem Statement:
One of the key problems to digital quizzing applications is the difficulty to generate a digital quiz. In order to solve this particular problem, you will be designing a Java based desktop application that provides an interactive interface to an instructor for generating a quiz.

# Problem Working details:
Start by designing a user entity, which holds at least the username, password, role and score. The username and password will be used by the application to authenticate the user, while the role can be either an instructor or a student.

Instructors after logging in, should be allowed to create a Quiz by providing a short title and description for the quiz. Once a quiz has been created, the application should then allow the user to add a question (of type multiple choice, true false or numeric). All questions will be indexed with their position editable by the instructor but not their content. For each question the instructor must add a text for the question, options (4 for MCQs, 2 for True False and none for numeric), expected correct answer (watch out for long expected answers. Sometimes it is better to match an expected option rather than an answer), and a maximum achievable score. On successful creation of the quiz, store its state
